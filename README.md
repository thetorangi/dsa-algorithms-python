# 📘 Algorithms in Python

This repository is my personal **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) roadmap in Python**.  
The goal is to create a **library of algorithms** implemented from scratch,  
organized by topic, with explanations, complexity analysis, and examples.

No problem-site naming — only **pure algorithms**.
